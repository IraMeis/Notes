# Bare Infinitive
## Where is used
1. User after auxilary and most modal verbs, but `we have to`, `ought to`, `be to` - we use them with `to`.
	`Need, dare, bid` - can be used with `to` or without it.
2. Omit `to` after `to help`, especially if the verb is followed by the pronoun object. 
	Ex: `Help me carry the box.`; `They helped me to carry the box.`
3. Bare infinitive is used after verbs denoting sense, perception. `To hear, to fill, to see, to watch, to notice, to observe etc.`
	Note: The verb `to be` is used with `to` after the verb `to feel`. `I feel it to be true.`
	Ex: `I saw her enter the room`.
4. Bare infinitive is used after the verb `to know` in the meaning **`to see`**. 
	Ex: `I've never known him drive so well`.
5. Bare infinitive is used after the verbs `to make, to have (заставлять), to let (позволять)`.
	Ex: `I had them take my luggage`.
	Note: The infinitive is used with `to` in `to get to (заставлять), to allow to (позволять)`.
	Ex: `We got mum to cut up some sandwiches.`
6. Bare inf. is used in special questions, beginning with `Why`.
	Ex: `Why not start earlier`.
	NB!: The verbs of sense and perception, and verbs `to make, to let` -> they require inf. with `to` after Passive Voice
	Ex: `I was made to mop the floor`
	`He was never known to tell lies.`
