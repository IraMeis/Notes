# Infinitive as the subject
- As the subject, the infinitive can go at the beginning of the sentence.
**Ex:** `To ride with the drunk driver is dangerous.`
- The sentence may also start with the introductory `it` as a formal subject. These formal subject is not translated into russian and we can easily rewrite the sentence to express the same idea without introductory `it`. 
**Ex:** `It's essential to get a visa = To get a visa is essential`
- Infinitive in the Interrogative is always found in introductory `it`
**Ex**: `Is it difficult to operate this machine?`

# Infinitive as the Predicative
- The infinitive can be used as the Predicative and in this case (`The weather (Subject) is nice (Predicate)`), the infinitive follows the link verb. (Link v + inf)
**Ex**: `My wish (subject) is to go (predicate) round the world.`
- If the predicative of the sentence consists of an adjective and an infinitive, the infinitive is called *the secondary predicative* (Link v + adj + inf)
**Ex**: `This story (subject) is *easy to believe* (predicative)`
- The infinitive can be the secondary predicative only in sentences where the subject is notional (условный)
**Ex**: `At first, our new boss was pleasant to deal with.` - Secondary predicative
# Infinitive as the purpose
- Used to tell why an action is performed.
**Ex**: `It came here to study English`
# Infinitive as the object
# Adverbal modifier of subsequent event
- Infinitive denotes an action that takes place right after another action expressed by the predicate
- We can rewrite sentence using `and`
**Ex:** `She woke up to see that the sun is shining`

# Complex Object (дополнение)
- A noun in the common case or a pronoun in the objective case + inf
**Ex**: `I saw `*the car dissapear*` in the distance`
- Что, чтобы
- Two subjects/persons are involved
**Ex**: `I think him to be a very clever man`
- Can be counted
# Complex Subject (подлежащее)
- A noun in the common case or a pronoun in the nominative case + inf

# Gerund
- Very close to infinite
- Synonymous functions

Something | Active | Passive
----- | ----- | -----
Indefinite (non-perfect) | Losing (transitive), Arriving | Being lost, -
Perfect | Having lost (transitive), having arrived | Having been lost, -

Indefinite - something about prior actions

- Verbs: `To remember, to excuse, to forgive, to thank and their synonyms` and after prepositions `on, upon, after and without` you should use indefinite gerund
**Ex**: `I don't remember seeing you before`
`Thank you for supporting me at the meeting`
`On entering the room, he was surprised to see many people`

- After the verbs `To want, to need, to deserve, to require` and the adjective `worth` we use active gerund, though the meaning is passive
**Ex**: `The dress needs irony`
`The book is worth reading`
`The city is worth visiting`
`The child deserves praising`
- With these verbs we can also use infinitive (active and passive)
**Ex**: `I want to borrow some money`
`The house needs to be painted/painting`
